# Digital-Thermometer
- A simple high-accuracy digital thermometer
- Created for the 2020-2021 Science Olympiad Event Detector Building
- Had to measure water temperatures 0-70 degrees Celsius with points awarded for accuracy and lighting LED's indicating temperature ranges
- Points were also awarded for a written exam on the theory of sensor operation and calibration
- Competed by me at the 2021 National Tournament hosted by Arizona State University where we took first in this event
- Capable of +/- 0.01 degrees Celsius agreement with its calibration thermometer
